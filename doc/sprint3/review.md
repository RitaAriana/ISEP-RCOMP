# 1. Sprint's backlog #
| Task | Task Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|T.3.1 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1.      |
|T.3.2 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. |
|T.3.3 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3.                                                                                       |
|T.3.4 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 4.                                                                                      |

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

## 3.1. 1201386 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1.  #
### Totally implemented with no issues. ###

## 3.2. 1201239 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. #
### Totally implemented with no issues. ###

## 3.3. 1200720 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3.   #
### Partially implemented with no issues. ###

## 3.4. 1201382 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 4.    #
### I can only make connections inside the building.
### As for the ACLs, I tried to implement them, but as I can't get them to work, there's only a configuration file in the resources with my attempt - "R0_B4_startup-config_ACLs.txt".
