# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

### 2.1. **1201386** - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building one, encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every member's Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation. 

#### Totally implemented with no issues. 


### 2.2. **1201239** - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building one, encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every member's Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.
