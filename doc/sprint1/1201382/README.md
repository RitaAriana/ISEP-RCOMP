>>### Outlets Layout
>>* There are no outlets in the common areas or in the WC's as there is no need.
>>* The number of outlets in each division was calculated using the proportion of 2 outlets every 10 meters.
>>* It was also taking into account that whatever point in the room to consider, an outlet is less than 3 meters away.
>>
>>![Floor0_outletsLayout](resources/Building4_GroundFloor_outlets.png)
>>
>>### Cables Layout:
>>Bearing in mind that on this floor, the cables are passed under the ground, the following procedure was carried out:
>>
>>![Floor0_cablesLayout](resources/Building4_GroundFloor_Cables.png)
>>
>>### Access Point
>>* Bearing in mind that an Access Point covers a radius of 25m, with the floor having 20x20x7m, choosing a midpoint and placing there the access point, the entire floor will be covered.
>>* Therefore, the Acess Point is located in the room 4.0.2.
>>* The acess point is connected to an outlet using a CAT7 copper cable.
>>
>>![Floor0_acessPoint](resources/Building4_GroundFloor_AccessPoint_Radius.png)
>>
>>
>>### Consolidation Points 
>>* On this floor, were placed 2 consolidation points - one in the room 4.0.2 and the other in 4.0.4.
>>* The connection to the HC is via the underfloor cable raceway.
>>
>>### Horizontal cross-connect
>>* Bearing in mind that one HC covers about 1000m2 and the floor has 400m2, one HC is enough for the whole floor.
>>
>>### Intermediate cross-connect
>>* The building's datacentre is located in room 4.0.5 so the Intermediate cross-connect was placed in this room located in the same technical cabinet as the Horizontal cross-connect.
>>* The IC receives optical fiber from the MC and passes the optical fiber to the two HC's in this building.
>>
>>### Main cross-connect
>>* The campus datacentre is located in room 1.0.2 of building 1 so the main cross-connect was placed in this room.
>>
>>### Cables used and respective quantities
>>* The outlets are numbered from left to right, top to bottom.

>>###Observations regarding the design of the Floor 1
>>* The ceiling height on this floor is 3 meters, but thereâ€™s a removable dropped ceiling, placed 2.5 meters from the ground, and covering this entire floor. 
>>* The space over the dropped ceiling is perfect to install cable raceways and wireless access-points.
>>* Common areas are not required to have network outlets, room 4.1.6 is a storage area, no network outlets are required there as well, and it may be used to house a cross-connect and other network infrastructure hardware. Other identified rooms must be provided with the standard number of network outlets.
