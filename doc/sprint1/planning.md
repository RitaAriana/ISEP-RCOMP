RCOMP 2021-2022 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1200720 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

For each task on this sprint, the output is a structured cabling project.
Each team member is free to provide this output in any desired format, it may be a single report or a set of items.
Whatever the format is, the following items are mandatory and will be subject of assessment:
- Demonstration of calculations regarding the number of network outlets for each room.
- Network outlets deployment schematic plan (including outlets for wireless access points) and justification comments.
- Cross-connects deployment schematic plan and justification comments.
- Cable pathways deployment schematic plan and justification comments.
- Hardware inventories, including total cable lengths by cable type, appropriate type patch
  panels, network outlets, telecommunication enclosures of suitable size.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

  * Backbone cable types to be used: Monomode Optical Fiber
  * End-User Equipment Cable: CAT 7A
  * Building Redundancy (Alternative Paths): To do when it is reasonabler.
    * To reduce redundancy we chose to use a fiber optic cable that will contain 8 optical fibers inside.
    
  * Cabling Infrastructure Standard: 568A
