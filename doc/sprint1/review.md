# 1. Sprint's backlog #

For each task on this sprint, the output is a structured cabling project. 
Each team member is free to provide this output in any desired format, it may be a single report or a set of items.
Whatever the format is, the following items are mandatory and will be subject of assessment:
- Demonstration of calculations regarding the number of network outlets for each room.
- Network outlets deployment schematic plan (including outlets for wireless access points) and justification comments.
- Cross-connects deployment schematic plan and justification comments. 
- Cable pathways deployment schematic plan and justification comments. 
- Hardware inventories, including total cable lengths by cable type, appropriate type patch
  panels, network outlets, telecommunication enclosures of suitable size.
